### Hearing Octaves as Vowels

Compare unfiltered pink noise with +12dB at the following freqs: 

#### 250 Hz – “U”

250Hz can be identified by an “u” or “oo” sound, as in “food”. If a mix contains an excessive amount of frequencies near 250Hz, it might sound “muddy”.

#### 500 Hz – “O”

500Hz can be identified by an “o” sound, as in “no”. If too much energy exists in this range, a mix might sound “woofy”.

#### 1 kHz – “AH”

1kHz can be identified by an “ah” sound, as in “aha”. If your mix has too much information in this range, it will sound “boxy”.

#### 2 kHz – “EH”

2kHz can be identified by an “eh” sound, as in “let”. Mixes with too much 2kHz will sound “bitey” and listeners might have difficulty hearing the vocalist if there are instruments competing for frequencies in this range.

#### 4 kHz – “EE”

4kHz can be identified by an “e” or “ee” sound, as in “bee”. The human ear is most sensitive to frequencies near 4kHz. These frequencies are also very important for hearing and understanding human speech. If a mix has too much 4kHz, it might sound “tinny”.

#### 8 kHz – “S”

As we move toward the high frequencies, the vowel sounds begin to be replaced by sibilant sounds. 8kHz can be identified by an “s” sound, as in “sam”. Too much 8kHz in a mix can be quite uncomfortable to listen to. The subjective word to describe this range might be “crispy”.

#### 16 kHz – “Ts”

16 kHz can be identified by a sibilant sound, as well. However, it takes on a more abrasive quality of “ts”, as in “tsunami”. If there is too much energy at these very high frequencies, a mix will have too much “shimmer”.

Also ISO standard ⅓-octave frequencies: 250Hz, 315Hz, 400Hz, 500Hz, 630Hz, 800Hz, 1kHz, 1.25kHz,  1.6kHz, 2kHz, 2.5kHz, 3.15kHz, 4kHz, 5kHz, 6.3kHz, 8kHz, 10kHz, 12.5kHz and 16kHz.
